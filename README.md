<h1>Weather Alert System</h1>

This Python script is designed to provide weather alerts based on OpenWeatherMap data and send a text message using Twilio when rain is expected within the next 12 hours at a specific location. To run this script, you need to set up a Twilio account and obtain API credentials and a phone number.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 35.
